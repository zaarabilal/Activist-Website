<h2 id="h2solutions">TACKLE THE ROOT CAUSE</h2>
      <h3 id="rootcause">Poverty is the cause of both the social aspects that make the educational experience unequal and the funding aspects. In order to reduce poverty, the government can provide income/economic support to those under the poverty line. Crime and other activities can also be minimized in poorer communities through patrolling.</h3>
      <h2 id="however"><i>HOWEVER...</i></h2>
      <h3 id="but">For tackling this specific situation, a solution focusing on education itself will be more effective as it can more easily make a change. </h3>
      
  <div id="solutions">
  <p id="tops">•In the short-run, teachers from wealthier and more academically rigorous schools can teach at the underserved schools. Often times having good teachers develops children’s interest in learning.</p>
     
  <p>•A long-run solution that can be implemented quickly as well is for the government to create a policy or law that creates rules for the maximum difference in funding that public schools in different communities can have. </p>
     
  <p>•A long-run solution that will target more of the social aspects of the unequal education system is making zoning to schools not based off of actual proximity to schools, but rather income. While this may seem odd, since studies show that higher income individuals have more motivation to learn in school, if there is a mix of both low and high income children, then all students will feel motivated. This will also allow children to be more comfortable with a diverse range of people. </p>
