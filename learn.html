<h2 class="h2learn">HOW ARE SCHOOLS FUNDED?</h2>
      <h3 id="funds">Determining how much funding a school gets is not reliant on one way, but rather a multitude of ways. However, a very large part of determining the funding of a school comes from the property tax of surrounding houses as this money is used for the school. This gives reason to the trend of seeing less renovated schools with old/used textbooks in poverty stricken neighborhoods.</h3>
