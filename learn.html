<h2 class="h2learn">HOW ARE SCHOOLS FUNDED?</h2>
      <h3 id="funds">Determining how much funding a school gets is not reliant on one way, but rather a multitude of ways. However, a very large part of determining the funding of a school comes from the property tax of surrounding houses as this money is used for the school. This gives reason to the trend of seeing less renovated schools with old/used textbooks in poverty stricken neighborhoods.</h3>

      <h2 class="h2learn">OTHER INFORMATION:</h2>
      <h3 id="info">School funding is not the only thing that makes schooling unequal. According to the University of Pennsylvania, there is a positive correlation between family income and a studentâ€™s GPA, SAT/ACT scores, graduation rank, and even armed forces test. Unfortunately in schools of poorer communities, the youth also have a lower incentive to achieve academic success. Since they are more likely to live near crime and other bad influences, education may not always be thought of as a top priority. Also, since everyone around them is in the same position as them since any well off individual would likely send their children to a better school, the cycle can never end. In order to end the ongoing cycle of unequal schooling and the continuation of the poverty cycle, something must be done. </h3>
